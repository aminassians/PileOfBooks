# PileOfBooks
Implementation of stack Interface using Array, Linked chain and Vector.
The project also has a test program for each implementation which is demonstrated as a pile of book. 
Each book is so large and heavy that you can remove only the top one from the pile.
You cannot remove a book from under another one. 
Likewise, you cannot add a book beneath another one. 
You can add another book to the pile only by placing it on the top of the pile.
